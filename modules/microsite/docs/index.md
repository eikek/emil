# E-Mail for Scala

Emil is a library for dealing with E-Mail in Scala. The api builds on
[Cats](https://github.com/typelevel/cats) and
[FS2](https://github.com/functional-streams-for-scala/fs2). It comes
with a backend implementation that is based on the well known [Java
Mail](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/mail) library. As such it is
just another wrapper library, but also a bit different:

- Extensible DSL for creating mails in code.
- Conveniently send mails via SMTP.
- Search mail boxes via IMAP.
- The data structures model a simplified E-Mail structure. Instead of
  adhering to the recursive structure of a mime message, a mail here
  is flat, consisting of a header, a body (text, html or both) and a
  list of attachments.
- The data structures and api are in a separate module, that doesn't
  depend on a concrete implementation library, like Java Mail. An
  implementation based on
  [fs2-mail](https://github.com/Spinoco/fs2-mail) or even
  [EWS](https://github.com/OfficeDev/ews-java-api) can be created
  without affecting the user code of this library.

Write your e-mail related code once and then decide how to execute.

## Usage

With [sbt](https://scala-sbt.org), add the dependencies:

```
"com.github.eikek" %% "emil-common" % "@VERSION@"  // the core library
"com.github.eikek" %% "emil-javamail" % "@VERSION@" // implementation module
```

Emil is provided for Scala 2.12 and 2.13.

There are [extension modules](extensions) that offer integration
with other libraries or additional features based on third-party
libraries.
